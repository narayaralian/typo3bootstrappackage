# An old version (6.2.15) of Benjamin Kott's Typo3 Bootstrap Package that I migrated to make it compatible with Typo3 8.7.27

The reason of creating this custom package: to upgrade websites built with OnePage static template. This template was removed from the higher versions of the Bootstrap Package, so, if the website depends on it, standard update of the extension will break the layout and navigation. Tested with PHP 7.3.6 and Typo3 8.7.27.
